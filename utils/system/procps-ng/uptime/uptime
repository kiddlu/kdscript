# System load averages is the average number of processes that are either in a runnable or uninterruptable state.  A process in a runnable  state  is
# either using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU.  A process in uninterruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for disk.  The aver‚Äê
# ages are taken over the three time intervals.  Load averages are not normalized for the number of CPUs in a system, so a load average of 1 means  a
# single CPU system is loaded all the time while on a 4 CPU system it means it was idle 75% of the time.
