1. top can miss:
   • short-lived processes
   • kernel threads (tasks), unless included (see top options)

2. analyzing high CPU processes:
   • identify why – profile code path
   • identify what – execution or stall cycles

3. High %CPU time may be stall cycles on memory I/O, upgrading to faster CPUs doesn’t help!
